# KeyLoggerv1
The first version of a simple python3 keylogging program.

Requires Python3, pynput, and logging libraries.

Once executed will record every key pressed on the target machine and store the output in a file called "keylogs.txt" in the same directory which holds the keylogging program.

This is for educational purposes only.
